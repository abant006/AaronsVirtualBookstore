# Aaron's Online Bookstore

**Welcome to my virtual bookstore!**

*What is this?* You might be asking right about now...

## Introduction
This is an application that works just like any other bookstore you may come across, except *everything* is done virtually. The store is loaded with 14 different books, mangas, and light novels! 

As we dive further into this manual, I'll go more in depth on the specifics, but for now I'll go over a broad overview of what the store has to offer.

Upon opening the store you'll immediately notice that you're being asked if you are an *Admin* or not. If you respond yes, you will be prompted to enter your login credentials. After that, you will be greeted with a menu asking what you would like to do. As a regular customer this all very similar, except you will not have to enter any login credentials.
