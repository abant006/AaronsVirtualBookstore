 * cpp file for the StoreUser class.
 * Defines all the functions (besides the pure virtual ones) declared within the header file for StoreUser
 * 
 * SUGGESTIONS:
 *  - MAKE A CLASS CALLED modInfo FOR ADMIN USERS THAT ASKS ADMIN WHAT INFO THEY WANT TO CHANGE
 *      AND IT WILL USE ANY OF THE CHANGE FUNCTIONS FROM THE BOOKLIST BASED OFF THE INPUT
